# "The Unseen Hand: Stylometric Analysis of Authorial Influence in Classic Literature"

### Corpus Overview
This repository contains a dataset that consists of three different corpus subcategories: the works of T.S. Eliot and Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot, and F. Scott Fitzgerald with Zelda Fitzgerald. The project aims to identify stylistic characteristics and authorship issues by analyzing the corpus sets. The project will explore, through an empirical approach, how these authors were influential for and interacted with each other, paying particular attention to the possible textual and personal crossovers in their writings. For the purpose of the present analysis, visualization tools like Voyant and stylometric analysis techniques-including the Stylo package in R and Zeta analysis were applied. It does this by supporting digital humanities research, textual analysis, and authorship attribution through a searchable corpus that investigates the stylistic and thematic connections among these writers.

### Corpus Description
The dataset includes a carefully curated selection of works of the authors’ pairs. These works are divided into genres and represent diverse themes of the 16th, 17th, late 19th and 20th centuries.
Highlights of the Corpus:

***Late 19th Century & 20th Century***:  F. Scott Fitzgerald & Zelda Fitzgerald, T.S. Eliot & Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot representing the Jazz Age, the Lost Generation, the American Dream, and the Modernist movement. 

`Selection criteria`

- Empirical Assumptions for Research: Books selected during the investigation had to have assumptions or hypotheses that were in need of further research. This category also includes works that may possess historical, stylistic, and thematic relations that need deeper analysis.

- Lack of previous research: As far as the project could perceive, preference has been given to books and author pairs without comprehensive research so the project should be able to contribute new insights into under-explored literary relationships and stylistic patterns.

- Accessibility for Extraction: Books were also selected to have a source in public digital repositories, allowing them to be extracted. Among others, sources freely available include the Project Gutenberg digital library and other open digital libraries, thus enabling one to include only those works that had sufficient digital records to analyze with research.

These include sharing a genre and themes of writing, falling in the same era of writing, and having some connection or relevance to the primary authors. These distractor authors allowed a deeper analysis of stylistic patterns, thematic overlaps, and potential influences. These include:

## Textual Analysis Tools
### Voyant Tool:
Voyant facilitates interactive textual analysis and visualizations to delve deep into recurring themes, word frequencies, and trends across the corpora of paired authors. This tool visualizes thematic emphases through word clouds and term frequency graphs pointing toward portrayals of gender, power dynamics, and creative influences.
### Stylometry:
Stylometry can now quantify responsiveness in the various writing styles of the paired authors. Using the Stylo package for R, word frequencies, pair of word frequencies and lexical richness are considered for the project to draw distinctive stylistic profiles for each author. These will be compared within and across pairs to find unique markers and overlaps.
### Zeta Analysis:
Zeta analysis is thus central to identifying stylistic and thematic distinctions within and across the works of the paired authors using the R environment. The preferred, avoided, or common words in view will highlight contrasts in writing styles and thematic shifts both within and across the works of paired authors.

## Outcomes
### This project will produce:
#### A complete Digital Archive:
A searchable, digitized archive of literature analyzed within the study, including corpora from F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda Fitzgerald, T.S. Eliot and Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot, and Mary Sidney and William Shakespeare. This will be useful for further study on the issues of authorship, stylistic influence, and thematic development.
#### Analytical Insights into Authorship and Influences:  
 In-depth analysis of stylistic characteristics, thematic overlaps, and empirical assumptions that surround each of these author pairs: the creative interplay between Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald, the emotional and literary impact of Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot on T.S. Eliot's works, and the debated relationship between Mary Sidney and William Shakespeare.
#### Interactive Visualizations for Stylometric and Thematic Trends:
 An interactive visualization approach, including word clouds, term frequency graphs, and Zeta analysis outputs, provides more accessible insights into stylistic and thematic contrasts within and between any two chosen authors. These will summarize regular patterns, common influences, and distinct writing characteristics.
#### Stylometric Profiles for Each Author Pair:
With the help of tools such as Voyant and the Stylo package in R, stylometric profiles will be generated that quantify and compare lexical choices, sentence structures, and thematic preferences across the works of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda Fitzgerald, T.S. Eliot and Vivienne Eliot, and Mary Sidney and William Shakespeare. The aim is to light up, with this insight, the connections and differences between each pair's literary contribution.
