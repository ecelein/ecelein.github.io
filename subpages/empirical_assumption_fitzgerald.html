                        “It seems to me that on one page I recognised a portion of an old diary of mine which mysteriously disappeared shortly after my marriage, and also scraps of letters which, though considerably edited, sound to me vaguely familiar. In fact, Mr. Fitzgerald . . . seems to believe that plagiarism begins at home” (Collected Writings 388).

                    <p>The couple had been married for less than a year when he quipped in a January 1921 interview, “Indeed, I married the heroine of my stories. I would not be interested in any other woman” (qtd. in Milford 77).</p>
        
                    <p>And when an editor, impressed by his wife’s writing, wanted to publish her diaries around this same time, he refused to allow him to do so because the editor later claimed, Fitzgerald admitted he was too dependent on them for material for his own fiction to share them with anyone else (qtd. in Milford 71).</p>

                    <h2>Key Points</h2>
        
                    <ul>
                        <li>The article on Literary Hub delves into the mythologised relationship of F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, highlighting the tensions, creative interplay, and personal struggles that defined their lives together.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Scott and Zelda’s romance has often been portrayed as glamorous and tragic, but their relationship was also marked by intense competition and mutual dependency. Zelda’s mental health struggles and Scott’s alcoholism created further strain.</li>
                            <li>Both drew inspiration from their lives, leading to conflicts over artistic ownership. Zelda’s novel <i>Save Me the Waltz</i> and Scott’s <i>Tender Is the Night</i> both mined their shared experiences, particularly Zelda’s mental health issues, for narrative material. This caused disputes, as Scott felt Zelda had preemptively used their history.</li>
                            <li>Scott’s <i>Tender Is the Night</i> offers insight into their turbulent relationship, with its characters reflecting aspects of their lives. The novel portrays themes of jealousy and the pursuit of wealth. Zelda’s behaviour, mirrored in the character of Nicole Diver, is contrasted with Scott’s struggles to manage both his personal and professional life.</li>
                        </ul>
        
                        <li>Daisy Buchanan’s line in <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, “I hope she’ll be a fool—a beautiful little fool,” was inspired by Zelda Fitzgerald, who expressed a similar sentiment after the birth of her daughter. &rarr; Daisy was inspired by Zelda.</li>
                        <li>F. Scott frequently drew from real-life experiences and relationships, particularly his marriage with Zelda, to shape his fiction. &rarr; That we already know.</li>
                        <li>The article examines how this practice blurred the line between creativity and appropriation, revealing the deep entanglement of the Fitzgeralds' lives with Scott's work.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Complex interplay between F. Scott Fitzgerald’s creative genius and his reliance on personal relationships for literary material.</li>
                            <li>The article critiques this method as ethically ambiguous, questioning the boundaries of creative inspiration versus exploitation. It reflects on how this dynamic affected their relationship, with Zelda often feeling overshadowed by Scott’s fame, despite her significant influence on his work.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Keats writes how Fitzgerald's extraordinary literary talent justifies his unconventional methods.</li>
                        <li>The text argues that Fitzgerald managed to create a coherent worldview despite the difficulty.</li>
                        <li>Although criticized for his personal life, Fitzgerald's ability to elevate the essence of Zelda into a creative work is impressive.</li>
                        <li>Fitzgerald is recognized not only as a writer but also for his artistic transformation of personal experiences.</li>

                    <h2>Key Points from J. Stolarek’s Article</h2>
                    <p><i>“The Influence of Zelda Fitzgerald on F. Scott Fitzgerald’s Life and Literary Output”</i> by J. Stolarek explores the intricate and often turbulent relationship between Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald and how their dynamic significantly impacted his life and works.</p>
        
                    <h3>Zelda as F. Scott's Muse and Co-creator</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Zelda inspired many of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s characters, particularly his portrayals of women in his novel <i>Tender Is the Night</i>.</li>
                        <li>Her letters were sometimes directly adapted or referenced in F. Scott’s writing, illustrating her influence on his creative process.</li>
                    </ul>
        
                    <h3>Mutual Creative Exchange</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The relationship between F. Scott and Zelda was marked by collaboration, but also tension regarding intellectual ownership.</li>
                        <li>Zelda’s letters often inspired parts of F. Scott’s work, but her contributions were sometimes overshadowed by his public recognition.</li>
                    </ul>
        
                    <h3>Themes of Marital Struggle</h3>
                    <p>The decline of their relationship mirrored the personal failure present in his novels. Zelda’s frustrations are highlighted in her own novel (<i>Save Me the Waltz</i>), which also drew from their shared experiences.</p>
        
                    <h3>Impact of Zelda’s Mental Health</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Zelda’s mental health struggles impacted F. Scott’s later works, such as <i>Tender Is the Night</i>, which reflects the emotional toll and complexities of their life together.</li>
                        <li>Her admittance into an institution for her mental health and their separation (she requested a divorce but he denied) are viewed as pivotal moments that shaped the darker tones of F. Scott’s later writing.</li>
                    </ul>
        
                    <h3>F. Scott’s Protective Nature Toward Zelda’s Legacy</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Despite their conflicts, F. Scott was deeply protective of Zelda’s artistic talent and reputation, often defending her potential as a writer and painter.</li>
                        <li>However, while this dynamic highlights Zelda's influence on Scott's work, it is not always characterized as theft but rather as a complex collaboration in which Scott often takes the lead.</li>
