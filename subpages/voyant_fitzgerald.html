    <h1>EULOGY ON THE FLAPPER VS THE GIRL THE PRINCE LIKED</h1>

      <p>The flapper that was intended to represent a liberating feminine identity ironically became an objectified figure that restricted Zelda’s freedom to realize her self-identity. Moreover it is interesting to consider that both Alabama and Zelda failed as dancers because their bodies were simply considered too old.<br>
      This suggests that feminine artistic expression is limited by bodily perception in a culture that commercializes female identity.</p>
  
      <img src="/images/stylo_fitz_5.png" class="analyses" alt="Stylo Fitz Analysis 5">
  
      <p>She primarily represents attractiveness using mostly positive words, correlating it with youth and respectability. When attractiveness and youthfulness fade, they appear less respectable and significant. This illustrates the commodification of the flapper.</p>
  
      <img src="/images/stylo_fitz_6.png" class="analyses" alt="Stylo Fitz Analysis 6">
  
      <p>Also in this cluster of words, it can be seen as well as in the other book from her (last analysis) how the main character’s name seems to be the one most frequent and then the adjectives that they are repeated the most are quite simple adjectives.<br>
      Therefore the style is the same.<br>
      Also written in past tense seen in verbs such as gave, wanted…<br>
      Also, the idea of youth really sought-after.<br>
      Of course flappers is one of the most frequent words, because it a topic<br>
      This one is not so much like the other one in a dialogue style (said is not one of the tops words)</p>
  
      <img src="/images/stylo_fitz_7.png" class="analyses" alt="Stylo Fitz Analysis 7">
  
      <p>Also this graph indicates the loss of innocence:<br>
      It is interesting how even though the right book is about a girl it is hardly mentioned in the corpus. The left book which talks about grown-up women refers to “girl” more than “woman” while the story talks about the commodification of the body of flappers.<br>
      And how the youthful expression is something that keeps being still between novels.<br>
      Something to take into account is the image of the divorced woman in the Eulogy book.</p>

    <h1>SAVE ME THE WALTZ VS TENDER IS THE NIGHT</h1>
  
    <div class="analysis-section">
      <img src="/images/stylo_fitz_8.png" class="analyses" alt="Stylo Fitz Analysis 8">
  
      <p>
      1. For the word cloud: it visually represents the most frequently used words. Words like ‘said’, ‘Alabama’, ‘dick’, ‘Nicole’, and ‘Rosemary’ are prominent → focus on dialogue and characters in the novels (2 names of characters are included).<br>
      We know that Alabama is the main character in Zelda's work and Nicole and Dick, are the ones in Fitzgerald's work.</p>
  
      <img src="/images/stylo_fitz_9.png" class="analyses" alt="Stylo Fitz Analysis 9">
  
      <p>2. For the graph: Shows the relative frequency of specific terms ("said," "dick," "like," "Alabama," "Nicole") across the two texts:<br>
      "Said": Common in both works, highlighting the significance of dialogue.<br>
      "Alabama": Dominates Save Me the Waltz, as Alabama is the protagonist and Zelda’s autobiographical counterpart.<br>
      "Dick": Far more frequent in Tender is the Night, reflecting Dick Diver's prominence.<br>
      "Nicole": Exclusively significant in Tender is the Night, where she plays a key role in the story.<br>
      Critical reflection: it does lower everything and as a result it doesn’t recognize words that should be written in capital letters, for example word ‘dick’ its the main protagonist in fitzgerald’s work but since its lower cased, its recognized in red as a word with a bad meaning.</p>
  
      <p>3. Summary (left down side)<br>
      Vocabulary Density: in Save Me the Waltz: 0.129 (higher), indicating Zelda is using a more poetic language.<br>
      Tender is the Night: 0.100, suggesting simpler or more expansive language.<br>
      Average Words Per Sentence:<br>
      Tender is the Night: 15.8 (longer, more complex sentences). → more descriptive, narrative style. , this can also be shown from the style of the sentences, more complex and big ones<br>
      Save Me the Waltz: 12.7 (shorter, more concise sentences). → can be combined with the poetic kind of view as well. , this can also be shown from the style of the sentences, more small ones including words more poetic.</p>
  
      <p>4. Theme Reflections in Vocabulary:<br>
      Save Me the Waltz's→ vocabulary density implies a focus on introspection and artistic detail, mirroring Zelda’s personal struggles<br>
      Tender is the Night→ uses its more expansive text to build a broad, multi-character narrative.<br>
      Both texts present a different perspective of their common experiences.</p>
  
      <p><b>Similarities of both texts:</b><br>
      Autobiographical Elements → Both of the texts focus on themes of mental illness, artistic ambition, and marriage.<br>
      Save Me the Waltz: Zelda fictionalizes her personal journey as Alabama Beggs, focusing on her search for identity, artistic fulfillment, and the strains of being married to a successful husband.<br>
      <b>Thematic Parallels</b><br>
      Marital Struggles: so scott writes from the perspective of the husband as Dick’s, and Zelda from the perspective of wife as Alabama Beggs. → exploring marriage problems and their position in a marriage.<br>
      Gender and Identity:<br>
      → Zelda critiques the limitations placed on women in her era, emphasizing Alabama’s longing for independence.<br>
      → Scott portrays Nicole’s dependence on Dick and his eventual unraveling, highlighting themes of control and sacrifice.<br>
      Similarity: Both explore the psychological and emotional toll of their respective roles in a marriage. But we can clearly identify that their idea of the position of the woman in a marriage is different. And also tension between personal ambitions and sacrifices requires in relationship.</p>
  
      <p><b>Stylistic Differences Within Similarities</b><br>
      Narrative Perspective:<br>
      → Scott writes with a third-person omniscient narrator, offering a more distanced and polished view of events.<br>
      → Zelda writes in a deeply personal, poetic style, often with fragmented and impressionistic prose.</p>
  
      <img src="/images/stylo_fitz_10.png" class="analyses" alt="Stylo Fitz Analysis 10">
  
      <p><b>Conclusion</b><br>
      The similarities between their works are undeniable because they stem from the same lived experiences and emotional struggles. However, they differ in perspective and focus: Scott’s Tender is the Night leans toward the husband’s perspective, portraying themes of control and moral failure, while Zelda’s Save Me the Waltz highlights a woman’s struggle for autonomy and self-expression. Together, their works offer complementary perspectives on the same shared life, creating a fuller picture of their complex relationship and era.<br>
      Also when we check the most frequent words:<br>
      We can check that the most used words are mainly names that are protagonists in both works and also some words focusing on dialogue.</p>

    <h1>SCANDALABRA VS THE VEGETABLE</h1>
    
    <p><img src="/images/stylo_fitz_11.png" class="analyses" alt="Stylo analysis 11"></p>

    <p>It can be seen all over again in the pattern of Zelda using more “like” than Scott. Even when the genre of both pieces to analyse is the same.</p>

    <p><img src="/images/stylo_fitz_12.png" class="analyses" alt="Stylo analysis 12"></p>

    <p>In this next visualization, we are comparing both plays; Scandalabra by Zelda and The Vegetable by Scott. In the trends, specific words are being searched as Lakoff said words such as “very, so, kind of, perhaps, sure, think” they are denoted by “female writing”. In order words, there is a sociolinguistic component that differentiates female and male writing. Women’s writing tends to use more hedgers as society made them believe that “asserting themselves strongly isn’t nice or ladylike, or even feminine” (Lakoff 1975: 54). In addition verbs like “let’s”, “could”, adjectives such as “maybe”, and other words such as “so”, “very”.</p>

    <p><img src="/images/stylo_fitz_13.png" class="analyses" alt="Stylo analysis 13"></p>

    <p>In this graph it can be seen that the use of so, think, very, sure, kind of, perhaps… It is quite equally represented in both plays. With a distinction in “very” which Zelda uses it more. On the other side, “so” its more frequently used it by Scott. Nevertheless, in the next picture, it can be seen the usage of “maybe” and “lets” which are supposedly to be female “writing”</p>

    <p><img src="/images/stylo_fitz_14.png"  class="analyses" alt="Stylo analysis 14"></p>

    <p>“Maybe” being majorly used by Zelda than in Scott, and “let’s” more frequent in Scott’s writings.</p>

    <h1>THE GREAT GATSBY</h1>
    <img src="/images/stylo_fitz_25.png" class="analyses" alt="Stylo Analysis for The Great Gatsby">
  
    <h2>Basic Analysis</h2>
    <p>Word cloud → more words are again names used in the story just like Gatsby, Daisy and Tom which are the main protagonists. → the words focus on personal relationships, dialogue and setting.</p>
    <p>We also have the use of "mr."</p>
    <p>Many verbs → indicating again the dialogue and narrative way of Fitzgerald's writing.</p>
  
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Vocabulary Density:</b> 0.122 → its really complex as a novel, a moderately dense text, with recurring words but varied language.</li>
      <li><b>Average Words Per Sentence:</b> 15.1 → big sentences, narrative style of Scott Fitzgerald, indicative of moderately complex sentence structures.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Trends Analysis - Graph</h2>
    <p>We specifically searched for "women," because women play pivotal roles in The Great Gatsby, particularly Daisy Buchanan and Jordan Baker, as representations of femininity, societal expectations, and personal agency in the Jazz Age. This graph shows the term "women" across the document. Peaks in frequency distribution can be found in specific parts of the text where the term is heavily used (2,5,7).</p>
  
    <h2>Context Analysis</h2>
    <p>The tool provides the immediate context (left and right) for occurrences of the term "said." This allows for a better understanding of dialogue structure and also emphasizes the appearance of dialogue in most parts of this novel. → focus on dialogue.</p>
  
    <h2>Analysis of The Great Gatsby in Relation to F. Scott Fitzgerald's Life</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Connections to Fitzgerald’s Personal Experiences:</b> Gatsby's obsession with amassing wealth stems from his desire to win Daisy's love—a reflection of Fitzgerald's own struggles with social class and ambition, as he struggled to gain financial stability in order to gain a social status and marry Zelda.</li>
      <li><b>Jazz Age Extravagance:</b> Fitzgerald and Zelda lived extravagantly by hosting or attending lavish parties, but this lifestyle led to personal dissatisfaction, debt, and disappointment. Gatsby's tragic pursuit of happiness through material excess (endless parties every day, blockbuster production, with only the famous and wealthy invited), ultimately leaving him unfulfilled and isolated from the woman he loved.</li>
      <li><b>Zelda vs. Daisy:</b> Shared traits: beauty, charm, and a drive to acquire wealth and social status. About Zelda: Daisy's shallow, whimsical nature can be seen as Fitzgerald's critique of Zelda's materialistic tendencies. Just as Daisy retreats into her world of privilege, Zelda's mental health struggles and their turbulent relationship deeply affect Fitzgerald.</li>
      <li><b>Women:</b> The frequency of the term "women" in the text underscores the novel's focus on gender roles. Women like Daisy and Jordan Baker are presented as complex but often constrained by societal expectations. Is this a matter of tradition? Or are they simply the author's personal perceptions being reflected? Is the author actually challenging the patriarchal system? Fitzgerald's personal struggles with Zelda, who also challenged traditional roles, are about women resisting but remaining entangled in patriarchal systems.</li>
      <li><b>Psychological and Emotional Nuances:</b> Gatsby idealizes love as well as success. Fitzgerald: melancholic tone of the novel --> dreams often collapse when confronted with reality.</li>
      <li><b>Self-destruction:</b> Fitzgerald's battles with alcoholism and his gradual professional decline parallel Gatsby's revelation. Chapter 5: “If it wasn’t for the mist we could see your home across the bay”, said Gatsby. “You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock”. → The green light at the end of Daisy's Pier symbolizes Gatsby's unattainable dream, as well as Fitzgerald's own struggles to reconcile his idealism with reality. It also reflects his longing for Zelda, whose mental health problems and material desires created an unbridgeable gap between them. Fitzgerald crafts a novel that critiques not only the societal flaws of the Jazz Age but also his own struggles with identity and fulfillment.</li>

    <h1>THE BEAUTIFUL AND THE DAMNED VS ZELDA’S SHORT STORIES</h1>
    <img src="/images/stylo_fitz_26.png" class="analyses" alt="Stylo Analysis for The Beautiful and the Damned">
    <img src="/images/stylo_fitz_27.png" class="analyses" alt="Stylo Analysis for Zelda's Short Stories">
  
    <p>The Voyant Tools analysis compares "The Beautiful and the Damned" by F. Scott Fitzgerald and two short stories by Zelda Fitzgerald.</p>
  
    <h3>Word Cloud</h3>
    <p>The word cloud visualizes the most frequently occurring words in the corpus. Larger words like "man", "time", "said", "eyes", and "little" indicate that these words appear often in the texts.</p>
  
    <h3>Trend Graph</h3>
    <p>The line graph displays the relative frequency of certain words ("like," "man," "said," "time," and "little") across the three documents in the corpus. "Like" is most frequent in the Eulogy document and less frequent in the others. "Man" and "time" have higher frequencies in "The Beautiful and Damned." "Said" and "little" are relatively consistent across documents but peak in different areas.</p>
  
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Highest Vocabulary Density:</b> Eulogy on the Flapper, 0.467 → rich and varied vocabulary.</li>
      <li><b>Lowest Vocabulary Density:</b> The Beautiful and Damned, 0.102 → repetitive language style, long narrative structure.</li>
      <li><b>Average Words Per Sentence:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Highest: The Girl the Prince Liked (33.0) → Zelda's story uses longer, more complex sentences → more reflective writing style.</li>
          <li>Lowest: The Beautiful and the Damned (16.1) → Shorter sentences may make Scott's novel more accessible or conversational.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Readability:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Highest: Eulogy on the Flapper (10.484) → more challenging to read, likely due to its denser language and complex ideas.</li>
          <li>Lowest: The Beautiful and the Damned (8.106) → easier to process or simpler language.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Interpretation</h3>
    <p><b>Theme Analysis:</b> The texts discuss societal roles, individual experience ("man," "time"), and conversational elements ("said"). Scott's work likely deals with overarching societal narratives and personal drama, focusing on characters' interactions. Zelda's short stories deal with cultural critiques (Eulogy) and emotional/romantic interactions ("The Girl the Prince Liked").</p>
  
    <p><b>Cultural Insights:</b> Eulogy on the Flapper discusses cultural shifts, contrasting with more narrative or descriptive approaches in "The Beautiful and Damned."</p>
  
    <p><b>Personal Life Reflection:</b> Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald both wrote during the Jazz Age, reflecting their lived experiences and perceptions of the era. But they approached it from different perspectives:
      <ul>
        <li>Scott's works focus on societal trends and characters' personal ambitions or downfalls, reflecting the external drama of the 1920s.</li>
        <li>Zelda's works critique the same culture from an insider's perspective, drawing from her struggles with identity, gender expectations, and creative recognition.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  
    <h3>Metrics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Zelda’s Writing Style:</b> Higher vocabulary density and longer sentences in her short stories show her focus on vivid descriptions and sophisticated storytelling. Her writing is more experimental and dense, with a focus on stylistic complexity.</li>
      <li><b>F. Scott Fitzgerald’s Writing Style:</b> Lower vocabulary density and shorter sentences suggest a more direct, narrative-driven style, relying more on character and plot. His style is more accessible, focusing on storytelling and character interactions rather than intricate reflections or abstract critiques.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Relationships Between the Works</h3>
    <p>Scott and Zelda's works might complement each other, with Scott focusing on external events and Zelda offering a more internal, critical view of the same cultural phenomena. Contrasts in style, including sentence length, vocabulary density, and readability index, reflect divergent creative approaches: Scott emphasizes narrative flow, while Zelda focuses on poetic or critical depth.</p>
  
    <h3>Final Assumptions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>The Beautiful and the Damned:</b> A grand narrative exploring broad themes of ambition, decadence, and societal norms, with accessible language for a general audience.</li>
      <li><b>Eulogy on the Flapper:</b> A dense critique of 1920s culture, reflecting Zelda's personal frustrations or insights as a figurehead of the era.</li>
      <li><b>The Girl the Prince Liked:</b> A dive into personal, emotional experiences or relationships, using long, reflective sentences and sophisticated language to create an intimate and lyrical tone.</li>
