      <h1>Challenges Faced in the Research Process</h1>

      <h3><u>1. Limited Short Stories for Comparison</u></h3>
      <p>
      T.S. Eliot has only one short story, which necessitated the selection of corresponding works from Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot in order to balance the two sets for a meaningful comparison. Additionally, for the comparison between Zelda Fitzgerald and Scott Fitzgerald, Zelda Fitzgerald has only written one novel, eliminating the available corpus for analysis. The lack of available works by female authors presented a challenge, as there was a limited corpus of texts by female writers to incorporate into the analysis.
      </p>
      
      <h3><u>2. Genre Discrepancies in Distractor Authors</u></h3>
      <p>
      Many of the distractor authors had works confined to a single genre, which made it challenging to create balanced comparisons. Specifically, for the distractor comparison between Zelda Fitzgerald and Scott Fitzgerald, it was necessary to identify multiple texts across 2 different genres, from 7 in total different distractor authors, to make sure that for each genre we have at least 4 distractor authorsâ€™ works.
      </p>
      
      <h3><u>3. Accessibility of Works</u></h3>
      <p>
      Not all of the relevant works were readily available online, as some were housed in private libraries and archives. Additionally, even when these works were accessible, we encountered challenges in extracting clean text by eliminating extraneous material, such as introductory notes and other non-relevant words.
      </p>
      
      <h3><u>4. Data Selection Challenges</u></h3>
      <p>
      During the data selection process, we identified five author pairs to analyze writing styles and detect potential plagiarism. However, we could only proceed with a pair if enough empirical assumptions were present to support a meaningful analysis. As a result, some pairs were excluded, and only those with sufficient empirical grounding were selected for the final analysis.
