        Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot heavily influenced T.S. Eliot. Her tumultuous existence provided the backdrop of creative inspiration. She gave life to the emotional depth and complexity of his poetry. It was later revealed in the  Statement by T. S. Eliot on the opening of the Emily Hale letters at Princeton University.

        Ian Butcher states, “Some passages of verse cannot be fully understood without knowing to which personal experience it alludes” (Prague Journal of English Studies 13.1: 31–49; Butcher 2024).
        “Vivienne nearly was the death of me, but she kept the poet alive.” (The Eliot-Hale Letters, 25 November 1960)
        ‘To her the marriage brought no happiness … to me, it brought the state of mind out of which came The Waste Land.’ (The Eliot-Hale Letters, 25 November 1960)
