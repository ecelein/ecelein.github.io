      <p>
        The Word Cloud highlights term frequencies and thematic significance in T.S. Eliot's works:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Time:</b> Prominent in <i>The Waste Land</i> and <i>The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</i>, reflecting existential angst and preoccupations with temporality. Minimal in <i>La Figlia che Piange</i>, where the focus is more on immediate imagery.</li>
          <li><b>Eyes:</b> Peaks in <i>The Hollow Men</i>, symbolizing both fear of being judged (others’ gaze) and blindness to truth.</li>
          <li><b>Wind:</b> Strongly used in <i>A Song for Simeon</i> as a chaotic force bringing death. In <i>The Hollow Men</i>, it symbolizes emptiness.</li>
          <li><b>Dead:</b> Most frequent in <i>The Hollow Men</i> and <i>The Waste Land</i>, emphasizing mortality and spiritual decay. In <i>The Waste Land</i>, "death" resonates hopelessness.</li>
        </ul>

      <img src="/images/ts_voyant_3.png" class="analyses" alt="Term Frequencies">
      <p>
        Contextual observations reveal deeper insights into term usage across poems:
        <ul>
          <li>Words like <b>"water"</b> and <b>"mountains"</b> in <i>The Waste Land</i> reflect despair (drought and absence of water) and potential renewal (water as nourishment).</li>
          <li>In contrast, words like <b>"pray"</b> and <b>"hope"</b> in <i>Ash Wednesday</i> suggest a more uplifting spiritual tone.</li>
        </ul>

      <p>
        Word trends reveal how T.S. Eliot’s recurring themes vary across texts:
        <ul>
          <li><i>The Waste Land</i> and <i>The Hollow Men</i> focus on decay and renewal.</li>
          <li><i>Ash Wednesday</i> and <i>A Song for Simeon</i> emphasize hope and spiritual awakening.</li>

        The most used word across her short stories is the name of the main character, "Sibylla." The second most frequent word is "said," indicating dialogue-heavy content. This aligns with the nature of fiction, where character interactions drive the narrative. It may also suggest simplicity and clarity in her storytelling.
