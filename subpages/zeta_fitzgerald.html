    <h1>TENDER IS THE NIGHT VS SAVE ME THE WALTZ</h1>

    <div class="analysis-section">
      <img src="/images/fitz_zeta_1.png" class="analyses">
      <p><b>WHY?</b> Zeta analysis for <i>Tender Is the Night</i> and <i>Save Me the Waltz</i> → because these two works are closely related in several important ways, making them particularly suitable for comparison.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Both novels draw heavily from the authors' personal lives and their tumultuous marriage.</li>
        <li><b>Gendered Perspectives:</b> The novels provide contrasting yet complementary perspectives on their shared experiences.</li>
        <li>Both novels were written in the same historical period (1930s) and reflect similar cultural, social, and literary influences, making the comparison more meaningful.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p><b>Preferred Words:</b> Words significantly more frequent in <i>Tender Is the Night</i>.</p>
      <p><b>Avoided Words:</b> Words significantly more frequent in <i>Save Me the Waltz</i>.</p>
  
      <h4>Analysis:</h4>
      <p><b>Preferred words in <i>Tender Is the Night:</i></b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Words like "don't," "he's," "isn't," and "you're" indicate a conversational tone and direct engagement with characters or dialogue.</li>
        <li>The use of words like "novel" and "moment" suggests a reflective or narrative style.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Avoided words in <i>Tender Is the Night:</i></b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Words such as "apartment," "money," "purple," and "shell" suggest a more material or descriptive tone in <i>Save Me the Waltz</i>.</li>
        <li>The word "danced" appears in the avoided section, indicating a recurring theme in Zelda Fitzgerald's work (possibly linked to the autobiographical nature of her novel).</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="/images/fitz_zeta_2.png" class="analyses">
      <p><b>Increased occurrence threshold to 4:</b> With a higher occurrence threshold, fewer words will be included in the analysis overall. This might lead to a more focused analysis of the most significant and frequent words in the primary and secondary sets.</p>
      <p><b>Analysis:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Preferred words in <i>Tender Is the Night:</i></b> "don’t," "he’s," "you’re," "that’s” — frequent use of contractions suggests F. Scott Fitzgerald's conversational and direct narrative tone aligning with his polished, modernist prose.</li>
        <li><b>Avoided words — preferred in Zelda’s:</b> "mama," "daddy," "lady," "protested" — These terms hint at a more personal and familial tone in Zelda Fitzgerald's work, reflecting her focus on intimate relationships.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Fitzgerald's polished and externalized narrative contrasts with Zelda’s more internal and emotional perspective.</p>
      <p>We conclude, therefore, that while in stylometry it appeared that these two works were quite close in terms of the words used most frequently, with analysis in 1-gram, 2-gram, and 4-gram, Zeta analysis shows they continue to have differences in diameter. This provides strong evidence that Scott did not resort to plagiarism from Zelda.</p>

While Zelda’s letters reflect raw emotion and introspection, the novel transforms these into a polished, dramatic narrative framework, emphasizing the dynamic between their creative voices.</p>

    <h1>Zeta Analysis for Short Stories</h1>

    <div class="analysis-section">
      <img src="/images/fitz_zeta_5.png" class="analyses">
      <h2>Why Zeta Analysis?</h2>
      <p><b>Craig’s Zeta Test:</b> It identifies words that are distinctively preferred or avoided in two compared corpora. In this case, the graphs highlight lexical preferences and avoidances in Scott's text relative to Zelda's texts.</p>
      <p><b>Why Change Occurrence Threshold?</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A threshold controls the frequency of words considered in the analysis.</li>
        <li>At a lower threshold (2), more words are included in the comparison, which can capture rarer stylistic markers but may include noise.</li>
        <li>Higher thresholds (4 and 10) focus on words that occur more frequently, potentially revealing more consistent stylistic patterns.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A lower threshold (Graph 1) includes more frequent words, while a higher threshold (Graph 2) highlights more distinctive or unique words.</p>

      <h3>Hypothesis Evaluation: Did Scott Copy Zelda?</h3>
      <p><b>Distinct Lexical Preferences:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Scott’s preferred vocabulary centers on narration and individual relationships.</li>
        <li>Zelda’s distinctive vocabulary reflects a vivid, socially oriented, and playful style.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Avoidance of Zelda’s Style:</b></p>
      <ul>

        <li>As thresholds increase, the findings become more robust, focusing on frequently used, stylistically consistent markers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This confirms that while Zelda’s texts contributed unique vocabulary to the comparison, Scott’s preferred words are distinct and do not indicate direct lexical borrowing.</p>
