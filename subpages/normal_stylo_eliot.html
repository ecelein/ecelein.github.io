  <img src="/images/stylo_eliots_1.png" class="analyses" alt="Stylo Analysis 1">
  <p>
    T.S. Eliot's <i>Eeldrop and Appleplex</i> stands quite apart from the cluster that Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot's works form. The implication is that the stylistic signature of each is radically different.
  </p>
  <p>
    T.S. Eliot's positioning closer to his modernist peers, such as Virginia Woolf (<i>Kew Gardens</i>) and William Butler Yeats (<i>The Binding of the Hair</i>), suggests a shared stylistic trait, likely due to modernist experimentation and the use of abstract language.
  </p>
  <p>
    In comparison with Hardy or Mansfield, T.S. Eliot is positioned closer to Haigh-Wood Eliot, suggesting perhaps that there may be some linguistic similarity between the two authors, but the stylistic divide between them remains quite large.

  <h2>MFW 100 2-grams Culled @ 0% Classic Delta Distance</h2>
  <img src="/images/stylo_eliots_2.png" class="analyses" alt="Stylo Analysis 2">
  <p>
    T.S. Eliot is distant from Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot, reinforcing their stylistic divergence even at the phrase level. <i>Eeldrop and Appleplex</i> still shares more similarities with works by Virginia Woolf and Thomas Hardy, suggesting a more complex sentence structure or thematic density compared to Vivienne's often more personal style.
  </p>

  <h2>MFC 4-grams Culled @ 0% Classic Delta Distance</h2>
  <img src="/images/stylo_eliots_3.png" class="analyses" alt="Stylo Analysis 3">
  <p>
    The 4-grams can confirm the stylistic gap between Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot and T.S. Eliot. <i>Eeldrop and Appleplex</i> remains in its own cluster, separate from Vivienne's cluster, which shows that even when analyzing longer sequences, their stylistic choices remain diverted.

  <img src="/images/stylo_eliots_4.png" class="analyses" alt="Stylo Analysis 4">
  <p>
    In this analysis, T.S. Eliot is placed considerably far from the cluster of Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot yet again, confirming that the stylistic division is consistent in earlier dendrograms.
  </p>
  <p>
    While both are modernist contextual authors, each has different means of approaching writing as we observe in the Voyant analyses as well: Vivienne with a somewhat direct and emotionally driven style of prose writing, while T.S. Eliot's work presents his trademark abstraction.
  </p>
  <p><b>
    As a result, the visualizations are consistent in showing the stylistic distance between T.S. Eliot and Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot, despite any thematic or personal overlap that may have existed in their work. The closer proximity to Virginia Woolf and William Butler Yeats points to T.S. Eliot's modernist identity, whereas Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot happens to be independent even from the stylistic circle of her husband, T.S. Eliot.

  <img src="/images/stylo_eliots_5.png" class="analyses" alt="Stylo Analysis 5">
  <p>
    MFW 100 highlights the most frequently used words:
    <ul>
      <li>The poems written by Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot, such as <i>Bel Canto</i> and <i>Song in the Night</i>, cluster closely together, indicating stylistic coherence in her writing.</li>
      <li>T.S. Eliot's poems themselves form a quite separate cluster, indicating his distinguishing style.</li>
      <li>Ezra Pound's texts likewise fall into a separate but cohesive cluster, reflecting his differing stylistic tendencies.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Additional Info:
    <ul>
      <li>Two branches can be seen. The top one, with a delta distance of 1.3, is composed of <i>The Cantos</i> by Ezra Pound. In this cluster, the main authors are Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot. In the most extreme node, it can be seen, with a distance of 0.8, <i>The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</i> by T.S. Eliot and <i>Hugh Selwyn Mauberley</i> by Ezra Pound.</li>
      <li>There’s an overlap observed in the works of Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot and T.S. Eliot. However, some texts by Vivienne (in particular <i>La Figlia che Piange</i> and <i>The Coliseum Dome</i>) appear closer to T.S. Eliot's works.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>This overlap could indicate:
    <ul>
      <li>Both authors being active participants in the modernist movement, which may explain the similarities.</li>
      <li>Their marital and literary collaboration leading to shared stylistic traits, especially in thematic or structural elements.</li>
      <li>Ezra Pound serving as a valuable distractor. His works consistently form a separate cluster, demonstrating that the method Juola proposes effectively distinguishes between authors with distinct stylistic profiles.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>MFW 100 2-grams Culled @ 0% Classic Delta Distance</h2>
  <img src="/images/stylo_eliots_6.png" class="analyses" alt="Stylo Analysis 6">
  <p>
    The usage of 2-grams (word pairs) makes collocations and phrasal choices evident. Compared to MFW-100, it is more detailed, and the clusters are tighter due to the additional specificity word pairs bring.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overlaps between T.S. Eliot and Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot persist, especially for texts like <i>La Figlia che Piange</i>, suggesting that phrase-level features alone may not fully separate authors of shared influences or collaborative histories. Further analysis using Voyant is recommended.

  <p>
    Character-level n-grams (4-grams in this case) focus on fine details such as punctuation and word endings. This approach captures stylistic elements not apparent at the word or phrase level:
    <ul>
      <li>Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot's texts cluster tightly due to her unique character-level stylistic patterns.</li>
      <li>T.S. Eliot's texts cluster together, underlining his distinct stylistic features even at the micro-style level.</li>
      <li>Ezra Pound's works remain distinct, reflecting his experimental use of language and form.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    However, this approach might be more prone to noise, such as formatting differences or typographical errors, affecting clustering accuracy.

  <h2>MFW 100 - 1000 @ 0% Classic Delta Distance Bootstrap Consensus Tree Consensus 0.5</h2>
  <img src="/images/stylo_eliots_8.png" class="analyses" alt="Stylo Analysis 8">
  <p>
    The Bootstrap Consensus Tree provides a stability analysis of the relationships between texts based on repeated resampling of the datasets. The following stable clusters are observed:
    <ul>
      <li>Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot: Her texts (<i>Bel Canto</i>, <i>Song in the Night</i>, etc.) consistently form a stable cluster.</li>
      <li>T.S. Eliot: His texts (<i>The Waste Land</i>, <i>The Hollow Men</i>) also cluster consistently.</li>
      <li>Ezra Pound: His texts (<i>The Cantos</i>, <i>Hugh Selwyn Mauberley</i>) remain isolated, demonstrating his clear stylistic divergence.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    However, the overlap between Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot and T.S. Eliot observed in the dendrograms is also evident in the bootstrap tree. Texts like <i>La Figlia che Piange</i> and <i>The Coliseum Dome</i> again show a closer proximity to T.S. Eliot’s works and must be investigated further.
