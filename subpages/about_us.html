    <h2>Contributions to the Field</h2>
    <p>
      This paper contributes significantly to studies on authorial influence, stylometry, and literary analysis to the extent that very modern computational methods shall be applied in an attempt to investigate the stylistic features that might reveal the affinity of famous literary authors regarding their authorship. Employing tools like Voyant, and R-Env will quantify linguistic patterns and stylistic features found in T.S. Eliot, Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot, William Shakespeare, Mary Sidney, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Zelda Fitzgerald. In fact, such a novel use of a distractor corpora, argued for by Patrick Juola, will also facilitate the identification of subtle influences and probable cases of literary borrowing or even plagiarism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The innovative nature of this project is in actually pairing with discussion topics that have rarely been held throughout history: Eliot and his wife, Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot, and the complex literary relationship between F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda Fitzgerald. More importantly, the investigation into the potential impact of Mary Sidney on the works of Shakespeare, in particular their shared themes and stylistic devices, calls for new perspectives on women's contribution in male-dominated contexts. This application of stylometry to the study of these dynamics has brought this subfield of authorship attribution to new frontiers and complicates the standard understanding of influence and collaboration.

    <h2>Purpose of the Research</h2>
    <p>
      The leading purpose of the present research is an analysis of stylistic features and identification of authors of some celebrated literary figures by means of comparing their works with the use of the most current computational methods. By a series of carefully constructed pairings-T.S. Eliot and Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot, Shakespeare and Mary Sidney, and F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda Fitzgerald. The paper tries to trace influences and interactions that could have presumably influenced their various outputs. The study is empirical research based on assumptions supported by historical context, which may be of help in demystifying hitherto lesser-known relationships of these authors concerning spousal and female author influence within the literary circles.

    </p>
    <p>
      The current research has filled in a number of gaps that were missing in the literary scholarship, particularly related to the area of gender dynamics in literature. New insights into the previously hardly discussed female contribution to male writers' creative work also offer new challenges to the traditional narratives about authorship and collaboration. Going further still, it reflects a more formal data-driven approach to authorship attribution beyond the traditional biographical or historical analytical approach toward one that is a more unvarnished quantitative examination of influence in literature. With that, this work will contribute significantly both to the knowledge of the field of literary scholarship and computational analysis since it is considered an extension of studies about how authors and the assessment of literary influence over time.

<h2>Contribution to the Research</h2>

<h3> ❧ Renia Korma</h3>
<p>
    Renia contributed to the Fitzgerald corpus analysis. She ensured the availability of the corpus and extracted the texts that needed to be analyzed. She organized and divided the Fitzgerald corpus, allowed the management of the project files, and set deadlines to increase the team's productivity. Renia also contributed to proposal development and presentation materials. She ran Voyant analyses for the detection of stylistic patterns for several texts (novels, letters of Zelda Fitzgerald, and short stories by the Fitzgeralds) working closely with Olga, and she ran R environment-based topic modeling, using the stylo package for conducting stylometry and Zeta analysis for Fitzgerald’s pair works. She also identified appropriate distractor authors for the Fitzgerald’s pair and contributed and refined the limitations of the project, while also creating the “Recommendations" and "Problems” section. Finally, she wrote the "About Us" section of her part, built the README on our website hosted on GitHub Pages and created the website www.the-unseen-hand.com.

<h3> ❧ Olga Rojas Valle</h3>
<p>
    Olga contributed to the Fitzgerald and T.S Eliot corpus analysis. She proposed the topic of the project and organized the division of 3 clusters of authors to be compared and analyzed. Olga meticulously arranged and collected the corpora and ensured that all necessary materials were accessible for the team’s work. She divided the author's clusters to balance the workload among members effectively. Additionally, she collected and documented the empirical assumptions behind each author to ensure historical and textual factors that might substantiate our hypothesis. Moreover, Olga was in charge mainly of Fitzgerald and T.S Eliot corpus, allowed the management of the project files, and set deadlines with Renia Korma to increase the team's productivity and the just division of tasks. Olga produced the presentation and drafted and collaborated to develop the proposal. She ran Voyant analyses for the detection of stylistic patterns for several texts (novels, letters of Zelda Fitzgerald, short stories by the Fitzgeralds, plays of Zelda and Scott, and lastly, Vivienne Eliot’s corpus) working closely with Renia. Olga identified and classified the appropriate distractor authors for Fitzgerald and T.S Eliot and contributed and refined the limitations of the project, adding to recommendations and the problems encountered. She also recollected and made sure that the corpora for the distractor authors of Fitzgerald and T.S Eliot were accessible. Finally, Olga did the quotes following the APA 7th style of the sources under “References”.

<h3> ❧ Ece Demirtas</h3>
<p>
    Ece contributed to the Eliot corpus analysis. She ran the Voyant analyses for the poems of T.S. Eliot as well as his short story. Then, worked in collaboration with Olga, which did the analyses for the counterpart, Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot. Ece also conducted the analyses using the stylo package for normal stylo and Zeta analysis for Eliot’s pair works. She also identified appropriate distractor authors for Eliot’s pair and built the website which is hosted on GitHub Pages.
