          Born in St. Louis, Missouri, to a prominent Boston Brahmin family, he moved to England in 1914 at the age of 25 and went
          on to settle, work, and marry there. He became a British subject in 1927 at the age of 39 and renounced his American
          citizenship. Eliot first attracted widespread attention for his poem "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" from 1914 to
          1915, which, at the time of its publication, was considered outlandish. It was followed by The Waste Land (1922), "The
          Hollow Men" (1925), "Ash Wednesday" (1930), and Four Quartets (1943). He wrote seven plays, notably Murder in the
          Cathedral (1935) and The Cocktail Party (1949). He was awarded the 1948 Nobel Prize in Literature, "for his outstanding,
          pioneer contribution to present-day poetry".
