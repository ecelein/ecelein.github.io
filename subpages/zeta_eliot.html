        T.S. Eliot has written only one short story, <i>Eeldrop and Appleplex</i>, which was published in two parts in 1917. For the analysis, we selected stories by Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot that matched in size, thematic relevance, and lexical similarity. The chosen stories are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Word Count:</b> The combined word count of <i>Night Club</i> (1,096 words) and <i>Medicine à la Mode</i> (1,762 words) by Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot is 2,858, closely matching the 2,876 words of <i>Eeldrop and Appleplex</i> by T.S. Eliot.</li>
        <li><b>Themes:</b> All three short stories explore social convention, human interaction, and interpersonal relationships. While <i>Eeldrop and Appleplex</i> delves into philosophical considerations of identity within a city setting, Vivienne's <i>Night Club</i> examines social performance and relationships in an urban environment, and <i>Medicine à la Mode</i> critiques superficiality in society and professional conduct.</li>
      </ul>

        Craig's Zeta analysis provides insights into word usage differences between the authors. The x-axis of the Zeta graph represents the word scores:
        <ul>
          <li>Words on the left (negative scores) are avoided in Vivienne's texts but preferred in T.S. Eliot's.</li>
          <li>Words on the right (positive scores) are favored in Vivienne's texts but avoided in T.S. Eliot's.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The corpora, both approximately 2,800 words, were sliced into 200-word chunks to maintain proportionality and emphasize statistically significant words while avoiding overemphasis on infrequent terms due to the small corpus size.

      <h2>Comparison</h2>
      <p>
        T.S. Eliot's work reveals abstract and intellectual tendencies, demonstrated by words like <b>classification</b> and <b>soul</b>, which reflect his philosophical concerns. The frequent use of urban-related terms like <b>London</b>, <b>street</b>, and <b>station</b> aligns with his modernist discourse on urban life. In contrast, Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot's stories focus on human and social relations, as highlighted by words like <b>lady</b>, <b>woman</b>, <b>doctor</b>, and <b>she</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vivienne's usage of action words such as <b>looked</b>, <b>stood</b>, <b>walked</b>, and <b>remarked</b> demonstrates an immediate and dynamic narrative style, in contrast to T.S. Eliot's reflective and analytical approach. On the whole, T.S. Eliot’s writings are abstract and philosophical, appealing to urban criticism, while Vivienne’s works offer concrete settings, character interactions, and emotional depth.

      <p>
        <b>1. Avoided Words (Left Side) – T.S. Eliot</b><br>
        Prominent words in T.S. Eliot's works include <i>shall, time, dead, silence, bones</i>. These words reflect Eliot's preoccupation with existential themes, time, and decay. Words such as <i>wind, mountains, land, garden</i> allude to natural imagery. Other significant terms like <i>there, where, if, about, think, between, still</i> indicate Eliot's reflective tone, highlighting his philosophical narrative style.

        <b>2. Favored Words (Right Side) – Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot</b><br>
        Emotionally charged words (<i>happy, never, always</i>) point to an emphasis on a character's emotions. Words such as <i>mother, him, me, Tom, Jack</i> reflect Vivienne's focus on characters in her narratives. Descriptive surroundings are highlighted with terms like <i>rose-pink, corridor, sky</i>. Immediate action words, including <i>wake, leave, stand, gone, looked, said</i>, are prominent in her writing style once again.

      <h2>Comparison</h2>
      <p>
        <b>T.S. Eliot:</b> Focuses on existential motives, imagery of nature, and abstract thoughts on mortality, spirituality, and decay.<br>
        <b>Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot:</b> Emphasizes humanity, dealing with social surroundings and feelings. Her work is more descriptive and direct, with attention to a character's actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        T.S. Eliot's abstract, fragmented, and symbolic language contrasts with Vivienne's concrete, action-oriented, and descriptive style. Eliot's poetry delves into mortality and spirituality, while Vivienne's texts underline immediate actions, surroundings, and emotions through her narratives.
